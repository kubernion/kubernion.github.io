# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01

At Kubernion, we believe in **Data Sovereignty**. **You** should own your data, **not** us.

## 1. No Server Tracking
We do not run backend servers that collect, store, or sell your personal information. This website is a "Static Application" hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 2. Local Storage
We use your browser's `localStorage` for the following purposes:
* **UX Preferences:** To remember if you have visited the site before (switching from "Initialization" to "Operational" mode).
* **Session State:** To keep you logged in during your session.

## 3. GitHub Data
If you use our Portfolio tools:
* We use the **GitHub API** to read/write data directly to **your** repositories.
* We never see your passwords. Authentication is handled securely via GitHub OAuth.
* Your portfolio data resides in your GitHub account, under your control.

## 4. Analytics
We do not use Google Analytics or third-party tracking pixels.

## 5. Contact
For privacy concerns, please open an issue in this repository.
